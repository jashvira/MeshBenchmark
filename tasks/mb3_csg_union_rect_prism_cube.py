# Base prompt template - DESCRIPTION is replaced per test case
promptTemplate = """
You can output polyhedrons in a json format. For example here is a simple cube, every face has 4 vertices, and there are 6 faces:

``` json
{
"polyhedron":
  {
    "vertex":[{"xyz":[-1.0,-1.0,-1.0]},{"xyz":[1.0,-1.0,-1.0]},{"xyz":[1.0,1.0,-1.0]},{"xyz":[-1.0,1.0,-1.0]},{"xyz":[-1.0,-1.0,1.0]},{"xyz":[1.0,-1.0,1.0]},{"xyz":[1.0,1.0,1.0]},{"xyz":[-1.0,1.0,1.0]}],
    "faces":[{"vertex":[3,2,1,0]},{"vertex":[4,5,6,7]},{"vertex":[0,1,5,4]},{"vertex":[7,6,2,3]},{"vertex":[3,0,4,7]},{"vertex":[1,2,6,5]}]
  }
}
```

Now you've learnt the format, use it to solve the following problem:

DESCRIPTION

Return a polyhedron that is the union of all the solid objects described above.
- Ensure faces have normals encoded in a consistent direction (outward-facing).
- Ensure no geometry occurs inside the polyhedron, and no faces cross through it.
- Note that some faces may have more than 4 vertices.
- Your output should have no degenerate faces or redundant vertices.
- The task is a failure if the output is not watertight.

CSG union of polyhedra is very hard without tooling, and hard to do right even with Python.

<br><br>

This test includes 23 different shape combinations: cubes, rectangular prisms, wedges, 
tetrahedra, cylinders (24-gon approximation), hexagonal/octagonal prisms, spheres (24-segment), 
cones, and complex multi-shape unions.

<br><br>

Most LLMs fail to output a closed mesh or correct winding order, 
and this shows up with OpenSCAD throwing errors when it tries to intersect the result
with a reference model.
