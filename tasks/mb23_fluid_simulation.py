You are given a 3D voxel world, of dimensions PARAM_A * PARAM_A * 8 voxels,
currently filled with rock uniformly flat and solid at the layers z = [0,1,2]

Rainfall occurs at the top centre of the world, and follows the following rules:
- If air is below water, the water falls (z = z - 1)
- If water has ground or water below it, it "flood fills" out looking for any air voxels 
  at the z level below it, and moves to the nearest one.
- If water touches the sides or bottom of the world, it falls off and is lost forever.
- If water can't find a reachable air voxel to move to, it remains there as a pool of water.

Since the world is currently flat, rainfall currently all runs off the edge of the map,
meaning earthworks are required to achieve your goals. After your earthworks complete, 
there will be 1000s of voxels worth of rainfall (mostly centred at the centre of the world)
before your world is graded.

You can specify earthworks using a simple json format:
{
  "earthworks" : [
    {
      "xyzMin": [2, 2, 3],
      "xyzMax": [6, 6, 3],
      "material": "Rock"
    },
    {
      "xyzMin": [3, 3, 3],
      "xyzMax": [5, 5, 3],
      "material": "Air"
    }
  ]
}
This would add a 5x5 slab of rock at z = 3, and remove a 3x3 hole from it, leaving a
ring of rock at z = 3. This would capture 9 voxels of water. 

Rock connected (orthogonally) to other rock is rigid and supports itself, allowing caves, tunnels,
bridges, overhangs, and promontories. Floating rock without any support structure will 
obviously fall to the ground.

Now you understand the format - here is the task I need help with:

Add rock or air voxels to the world in order to ensure that after the rains end,
