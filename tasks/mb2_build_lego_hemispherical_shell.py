title = "Build a Lego(tm) hemispherical shell"

prompt = """
You have an unlimited number of Lego(tm) bricks, each of individual size 31.8mm * 15.8mm * 11.4mm but when assembled they are 
32mm * 16mm * 9.6mm due to interlocking studs and voids. Each brick has 8 studs, in a 2x4 layout. 

These bricks snap together. For example: A brick at (centroid=[0, 0, 4.8],r=90) is resting on the ground centred over the origin, 
and a second brick at (centroid=[0, 0, 14.4],r=180) is clicked into the first brick with 4 interlocked studs (out of 8). A third brick at 
(centroid=[24, 0, 24],r=0) is snapped into 2 studs of the second brick, forming a 75% overhang. Were that third brick at 
[22,0,24] instead, its shell would intersect 2 studs of the Lego brick below it, and thus not be buildable.

Assemble the bricks such that they resemble a 3D hemispherical shell, with inner radius PARAM_A cm and outer radius PARAM_B cm, 
the centre of the hemisphere is at the origin (0,0,0).

Since it's impossible to create a perfect curve, the best score is one which is closer to the ideal curve, with
scoring being calculated based on the volume difference between the ideal curve and the actual brick structure. 
The structure needs to be buildable in 3D, so bricks can not overlap or be floating in mid air. A great answer does not 
contain any holes or missing bricks.

Blocks are being placed directly on a flat surface, i.e. without a base plate, so those resting on the ground can have
any orientation and are not confined to a specific grid structure. Connected blocks must follow legal Lego(tm) connection
rules and must not fall over when built. (Two unstable structures leaning on each other will push each other apart and fall over)

Return a list of the bricks. (location in xyz mm relative to the origin and rotation in degrees).
